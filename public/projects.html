                            Currently, there is no publicly available way for alpine ski racers to calculate what they “scored” until a third party performs the calculation and uploads the file. This process can take hours. Knowing what you scored can be a make or break factor in how you feel about your performance as an athlete. The better you score, the lower your world ranking may become. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a result, I decided to develop a program to help reduce the time of this waiting game. A user can enter a link to a live-timing.com race results page. The link then gets sent to a <b>Python</b> program using the spawn feature of the child_process package in <b>JavaScript</b> via a server run with <b>Express</b> through <b>Node.js</b>. The Python program uses the <b>Selenium</b> library to scrape the webpage and extract any information that is necessary for the points calculation. Each racer's name and points is stored as a key-value pair and sent as a JSON object back to the <b>HTML</b> where it is displayed for the user to see.
                        </p>

                        <p>The game has a 1 player (which loads a list of words from a file and chooses a random one) or a 2 player mode (where Player 1 can input a word of their choice for Player 2 to guess).

                        <p>Built using <b>Python</b> as part of a Foundations of Programming course.
                            </br>

                        </p>
                        <p>Created a Reddit account for a bot that would rig a fake election that was set up on a Subreddit page created by the professors. The bot would post spam comments in support of a fake political candidate in order to garner support for them. 
                            </br>
                        The program uses the Reddit PRAW library to log into the account, access all the posts, comments and replies on the given Subreddit then goes through everything to see if your bot has posted a comment under the respective item. When it reaches an item that your bot has not interacted with, it will generate a comment using a loaded text file with madlibs style fill-in-the-blank comments to increase the randomness of the comment. A bot daemon was used to ensure that the program would not post a comment more than once per minute.

                        <h3>Zombie Apocalypse</h3>
                        <p>Built using <b>Java</b> as part of an Intro to Computer Science/Object Oriented Programming course.
                            </br>
                            Focus on learning how to implement algorithms into programs.
                        </p>
                        <p>2D maps was displayed using a GUI which had different regions. Each type of region tile had different damage, time, and distance values. The goal was to try and find various paths from point A to B in the most optimal way.  
                            </br>
                            Used breadth first search and depth first search. Weighted edges were used to gauge the value of each connection between the tiles on the paths. Dijkstra's algorithm was implemented to find the shortest path based on either minimum distance or fastest time. The program took potential waypoints into account if certain stops were necessary in the path. 
                            </br>
                            A constrained shortest path program was implemented using LARAC (Lagrangian Relaxation Based Aggregated Cost) algorithm which would track whether the amount of damage on the path would cause the user to die before making it to the safe house. The optimal path was created by using the best distance or time where health was not depleted.

                            </br>
                            Focus on hierarchy, nodes, heaps, linked lists, and binary search trees.
                        </p>
                        <p>Different cats are created with traits based on age, and fur thickness. The cats are arranged by seniority in a combination of a binary search tree (for the cats' seniority) and a max heap (for the cats' fur thickness). When a cat is added or removed, the heap tree is reorganized using specific algorithms for left and right rotations, and upheaping and downheaping. Other algorithms are used to search the tree for the most senior or junior cat. An iterator is also implemented.</p>

                            First ever project built using Java with a heavy focus on classes and inheritance.
                        </p>
                        <p>The concept of the game is that bees and hornets fight in a tower defense game. A GUI gives us the ability to visually act out this game. Different types of bees are created using inheritance and different classes. Certain traits and abilities are overridden to make each bee unique. Functions were created with the purpose of knowing the locations of bees and hornets on the tiles, adding health, attacking opposing creatures, moving the creatures, and adding them to the tiles.</p>

                        <p>Takes a string of 0s and 1s and uses this information to create images with black and white pixels. Functions were created to manipulate the images by changing the string.
